<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>
    Welcome to programming! With this course you will learn the basics of programming.
    You will learn and use the Python language syntax to exercise these programming basics.
    No prior programming skills or knowledge is needed for this course.
</p>
<h2>Why Python?</h2>
<p>
    <b>Why not?!</b>
    Any programming language is suitable to start learning programming.
    As long as you want to learn and take your time.
    The Python language is being greatly used for teaching and learning programming.
    Therefore there are a ton of resources online that are usefull for learning.

    As the course title says: The basics of programming.
    All these basics also translate to other programming languages.
    After successfully finishing this course you will be able to not only use Python in a very basic way, but also other programming languages after a little research on their syntax.
